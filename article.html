          <h1>Why is Trivia Crack so Popular?<h1>
            <h4><span class="label label-default"><a style="color:inherit;"href="#">Antony Rossi</a></span></h4>
              <p>As many of us have seen through the past few weeks,  there seems to be a new game that just about everybody is playing. This game is commonly known as Trivia Crack. As the name implies, it is a game that is focused on testing the trivial abilities of teens and adults alike. This game has peaked the interest of many people throughout the few weeks that it has been around. And as many of us have found, this game is relatively addicting, as well as fun.</p>
              <p>Trivia Crack is one of the top downloaded apps throughout the past few weeks, and the worldwide downloads keep coming. More and more people are downloading it on their smart phones and Ipods everyday. The game itself is popular among many students in Memorial. Students can be seen almost everywhere playing this game, myself included. The game, yes as fun as it is, does distract students from their school work.</p>
              <P>Personally,  I find the game to be a fun, mobile trivia game where I can learn a few little facts everyday. With that said, I'm sure that some of you think this as well. Also, anybody who has downloaded this game has the ability to manufacture trivia questions for world wide Trivia Crack players to be asked. The questions can be made for one of six trivial categories,  whichever you choose. The six categories include geography, science, history, sports, art, and entertainment.  These categories include questions implied through their name. Despite the category names,  I find that some questions seem to be in the wrong category. I find that the most common mix up between question categories seem to to be between the art and entertainment categories due to movies and music being arts.</p>
              <p>Despite these slight mix ups with the questions in game, this game continues to be played by many people worldwide, and many people you may know yourself. The downloads keep coming and more and more people are playing Trivia Crack everyday.</p>
